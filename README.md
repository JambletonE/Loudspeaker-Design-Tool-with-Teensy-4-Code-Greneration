# Loudspeaker Design Tool with Teensy 4 Code Generation


This is a repository for a loudspeaker electroequivalent model, developed for part of a Masterâ€™s thesis. 

In order to use the tool a working copy of MATLAB; with the Audio Toolbox, 
Simscape, and Simulink add-ons, is required, in addition to an installed C compiler, such as MinGW. 

Start by opening: a_LS_model.slx

You will then be presented with:

Signal chain for both simulation and microcontroller is:

Users are able to enter Thiele and Small parameters and view modelled loudspeaker 
frequency responses.

Enter Thiele-Small parameters, input signal duration, parametric EQ controls, crossover parameters, and delay sttings are entered through the above icons, and view plots here:

The tool produces a .txt file, the contents of which can be uploaded to a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller. Produced plots can be automatically saved in a folder.

Name both the save .txt and figure folder here:

Uploading of the generated script can be done using the Arduino SDK. The Teensy then implements  filtering such as parametric EQ and crossover, as well as delay, in real time. 

More info on the Teensy and how to upload code can be found here:

Make sure stop time is set to the same as the sweep time input 

Various outputs of the tool can be seen below, some axis have been edited for readability:
