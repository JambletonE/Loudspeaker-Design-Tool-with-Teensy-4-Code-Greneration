# Loudspeaker Design Tool with Teensy 4 Code Generation


This is a repository for a loudspeaker electroequivalent model, developed for part of a Masterâ€™s thesis. 

In order to use the tool a working copy of MATLAB; with the Audio Toolbox, 
Simscape, and Simulink add-ons, is required, in addition to an installed C compiler, such as MinGW.

Signal chaincan be seen above

Open and run: a_LS_model.slx

Users are able to enter Thiele and Small parameters and view modelled loudspeaker 
frequency responses.

![Main Inputs](input.png)

Enter Thiele-Small parameters, input signal duration, Parametric EQ controls, and Crossover parameters here. Go to these parameters to view various plots.



The tool produces a .txt file, the contents of which can be uploaded to a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller. Produce plots can be automatically saved in a folder.

![Box modes](modes.png)

Box resonant modes can be entered and calculated here.

![Frequency and Time Domain](time.png)
Simulation output for frequency and time domain plots can be seen here.

![Script save](Teensy.png)

Name both the save .txt and figure folder here.

Box modes can be 
using the  that Arduino SDK. The Teensy then implements  filtering such as parametric EQ and crossover.   ```

Various outputs of the tool can be seen below, some axis have been edited for readability:
