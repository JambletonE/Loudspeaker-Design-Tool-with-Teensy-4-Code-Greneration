# Loudspeaker Design Tool with Teensy 4 Code Generation


This is a repository for a loudspeaker electroequivalent model, developed for part of a Masterâ€™s thesis. 

In order to use the tool a working copy of MATLAB; with the Audio Toolbox, 
Simscape, and Simulink add-ons, is required, in addition to an installed C compiler, such as MinGW. 

Start by opening: a_LS_model.slx

![Signal chain](full_LS.png)

You will then be presented with the above.


![Signal chain](flow.png)

Signal chain can be seen above

Users are able to enter Thiele and Small parameters and view modelled loudspeaker 
frequency responses.

![Main Inputs](input.png)

Enter Thiele-Small parameters, input signal duration, parametric EQ controls, crossover parameters, and delay sttings are entered through the above icons. You can view various plots here as well.



The tool produces a .txt file, the contents of which can be uploaded to a Teensy 4.1 microcontroller. Produced plots can be automatically saved in a folder.

![Script save](script.png)

Name both the save .txt and figure folder here.


Uploading of the generated script can be done using the Arduino SDK. The Teensy then implements  filtering such as parametric EQ and crossover, as well as delay, in real time. 

More info on the Teensy and how to upload code can be found here:

![Box modes](modesRme.png)

Box resonant modes can be entered and calculated through clicking on the above icon.

![Frequency and Time Domain](time.png)
Simulation output for frequency and time domain plots can be seen through the above.


To run the simulation navigate to the Simulation tab and select 'run'.


Various outputs of the tool can be seen below, some axis have been edited for readability:
